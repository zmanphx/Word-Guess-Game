# Word-Guess-Game
Word Guess Game Java Script HW. Most of the logic resides in the game object. This 
assignment was to demonstrate use of java script and objects. 
This is the Super Hero Guess Game. Guess the names of Super Heros. 
There are 5 total names in the Array. 
Each time you play it deletes the one just played. 
After the array list is empty the game will reset . 
The game will go on to the next shuffled name in the array after playing
the last and will keep track of  Wins and Losses. 
I added sound effect to the intro when doing Any Key start.
Sound effects when you guess the word for Wins and sound effects when you run out 
of tries. You get 10 tries.
